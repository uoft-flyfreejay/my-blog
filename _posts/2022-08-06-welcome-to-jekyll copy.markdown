## Intro

I will use this page to record how I tackled some of the boxes and any relevant notes on them. 

## Starting Point Tutorials

I guess the biggest issue when I tackled the machine is swapping `caps_lock` and `ctrl`. 

```
sudo nano /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/pc
```

Simply swapping the entry for `caps_lock` and `lctrl` did the trick. Other than that, the machine itself was straight forward.
