My name is Jay, and I am an undergraduate student at [The University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) studying Computer Science. I once aspired to be a hacker and start my career in the field of cybersecurity, because being hacked while playing a video game called *Starcraft* is how I became interested in the field of computer science. Now, I simply wander around many different specializations in computer science discovering where my heart truly lies in.
